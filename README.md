# EduNotes

**online_notiz_template** is a mock project designed for educational purposes to illustrate a realistic software supply chain. It includes frontend and backend folders with simulated source code and dependencies, and is intended for generating and analyzing Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is not a functional application and is not intended for execution or deployment. It serves purely as a reference example for software supply chain analysis.

## Structure

- `frontend/` - React-based mock frontend with `package.json`
- `backend/` - Express-based mock backend with `package.json`
- `Dockerfile` - Example container build script
- `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `LICENSE` - Standard project files

## Usage

Use this repository to:
- Practice generating SBOMs
- Explore common JavaScript/Node.js dependencies
- Teach or learn about software supply chain security
